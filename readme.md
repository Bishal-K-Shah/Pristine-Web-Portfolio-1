Project : Pristine Web
Description:
This web project introduces a structured approach for customers, allowing them to navigate through two fundamental questionnaires: a general requirement gathering questionnaire (Questionnaire 1) and a price-based questionnaire for the components of customerâ€™s website (Questionnaire 2). The first questionnaire focuses on general requirement gathering, allowing customers to provide specific details about their web project. The second questionnaire is tailored towards pricing aspects, enabling customers to specify the components they desire for their website within budget constraints. These questionnaires aim to facilitate the handover of the customer's web project to the admin and enable a streamlined checkout process.
